#DogDash -dog walking project

This application is used for people who want their dogs to be walked. Either for help or for their convenience.

This application uses .localStorage for the sign up forms and openweather api for the user to check their local weather.

Some of the challenges I faced making this website was utility of the weather API, I couldn't figure out how to use it after tedious attempt.
